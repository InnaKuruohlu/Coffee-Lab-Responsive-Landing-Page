# Coffee-Lab-Responsive-Landing-Page
Built a fully responsive coffee shop landing page using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript.

The website includes multiple interactive sections such as a mobile-friendly navigation menu with smooth open/close animations and automatic header styling on scroll. 
Each section (Home, About, Catalog, Reviews, and Contact) is connected via in-page anchor navigation with smooth scrolling.
Also implemented form validation using HTML5 attributes and regular expressions for accurate user input.

Tech stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling, responsive design).
